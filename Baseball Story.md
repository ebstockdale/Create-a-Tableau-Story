Summary: 

The dataset we are using (baseball_data.csv) consists of data on 1157 players and includes the following: 

Name: First and Last
Handedness: left, right or both
Height: in inches
Weight: in pounds
Avg: batting average
HR: number of home runs


I will analyze player attributes included in the dataset to determine what could make some players better than others. 

Upon analyzing the dataset, I demonstrated that left handed players have an advantage especially when it comes to HR, but height and weight play a more significant role when it comes to home run and batting average stats. 

Design:

Design Decisions: For my design process, I used visualizations to answer the following questions: 

1) What is the relationship between home run (HR) and batting average?
2) What are the names of players with the top 20 home run and batting average stats?
3) What are the average home run and batting average by handedness?
4) What are the home run vs weight and height stats?
5) What are the batting average weight and height stats?
6) What player attributes play a more significant role when it comes to performance?

Audience: Udacity, Tableau public





Chart Types: 

Scatter plot – Tab 2: Demonstrates the relationship between HR and batting average. I chose scatter plot because it most clearly represented the relationship.
 
Horizontal bar graph – Tab 3: Demonstrates that left handed players have an advantage especially when it comes to HR, but height and weigh play a more significant role when it comes to home run and batting average stats. Horizontal bar graph was chosen because it clearly shows at a glance the advantage left-handed players have for HR. 

Horizontal bar graph – Tab 4: Shows a clearer relationship between left-handed players and higher HR stats but not for batting average. For this data, a horizontal bar graph is the best method for comparison.

Histograms – Tab 5: Here is use histograms to show how a player's weight and height have an even stronger relationship to HR and batting average. Histograms are a great way to display continuous data and so I chose to use them for this tab.  


Feedback received:

*Add a little additional text describing the visualization and what it shows for this tab.  Imagine that the viewer has no understanding of data visualizations. 

After receiving this feedback, I edited tab #3 in my Tableau story to include the sum of HR and sum of batting average to the labels and included them within the horizontal bar graphs for easy readability. I removed the label showing handedness next to the bar graphs as this information was already included as a tool tip and was redundant.
