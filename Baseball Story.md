Summary: 

The dataset we are using (baseball_data.csv) consists of data on 1157 players and includes the following: 

Name: First and Last
Handedness: left, right or both
Height: in inches
Weight: in pounds
Avg: batting average
HR: number of home runs


I will analyze player attributes included in the dataset to determine what could make some players better than others. 

Design:

Design Decisions: For my design process, I used visualizations to answer the following questions: 

1) What is the relationship between home run (HR) and batting average?
2) What are the names of players with the top 20 home run and batting average stats?
3) What are the average home run and batting average by handedness?
4) What are the home run vs weight and height stats?
5) What are the batting average weight and height stats?
6) What player attributes play a more significant role when it comes to performance?

Audience: Udacity, Tableau public

Chart Types: I used a scatter plot as well as bar charts and histograms

Feedback:

Add a little additional text describing the visualization and what it shows for this tab.  Imagine that the viewer has no understanding of data visualizations.
